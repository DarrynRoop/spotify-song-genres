Final Project for Machine Learning Course

To program this assignment, we used an iPython notebook. All the code is already run and can be viewed in the included html file.

To run the code yourself, you will need to run the notebook in a Google Colab instance.\
Run the first code cell to import libraries (all the dependencies are included with Colab) then upload the data csv file in the second code cell. Then, run the rest of the code cells sequentially.
